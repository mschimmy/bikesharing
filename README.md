# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The client requested a business proposal be made for the bike-sharing company Citi Bike. The proposal uses public data for the Citi Bike program in New York City for the month of August 2019.

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to provide evidence that will help determine the amount of funding needed from an angel investor to begin a Citibike program in Des Moines, Iowa. The results of the analysis are shared to a [public Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/madison.schimmel/viz/bikesharingworkbook/Challenge14?publish=yes) and further described in this analysis.

## Results
describe the results for each visualization
![Peak hours for August](link)
The peak usage hours for August in NYC were between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm. This is the time during the day in which users need the most bikes, and can be used to determine how many bikes will be needed in Des Moines. The hours with the least amount of usage is between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am. It would be best to perform maintenance on bikes during these hours.

![Trips by weekday (per hour)](link)
The trips by weekday (per hour) heatmap follows a similar trend as the previous peak hours bar graph. During the work week, peak hours are between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm, as well as in the mornings between 6:00 am and 10:00 am. An explanation for this trend could be users using the Citi Bike program to commute to and from work. On the weekends, most trips are taken between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm.

![Trips by gender (weekday per hour)](link)
The trips by gender (by weekday per hour) heatmaps further break down the previous heatmap by gender: male, female, and unknown. According to the heatmaps, most users during the week (including weekends) are male. Users with an unknown gender use the Citi Bike program more during the weekend than during the workweek. An interesting point to note in these heatmaps is in the breakdown for males, where there seems to be more rides during the late hours between 10:00 pm and 2:00 am. This could be due to the nightlife scene in New York City and a Citi Bike program in Des Moines, Iowa may not follow this particular pattern.

![User type](link)
The user type pie chart shows the proportion of short-term customers to Citi Bike annual subscribers in New York City. Approximately 80% of users were subscribers, while the remaining 20% were short-term customers. It is predicted that user types in Des Moines would follow a similar trend. 

![User trips by gender by weekday](link)
The user trips by gender (by weekday) heatmap combines the previous user type pie chart with the heatmaps that show the breakdown of trips by gender (by weekday per hour). This heatmap shows that more than half of users (58%) are male subscribers. It is fair to assume that a Citi Bike program would follow this trend.

![Checkout times for users](link)
The checkout times for users line graph shows the distribution of trip duration for all users. The graph shows that 99% of rides were less than an hour long (60 minutes), and the mode of trip duration for all users is 5 minutes.

![Checkout time for users by gender](link)
This line graph breaks down the previous graph by gender, and follows a similar trend of 99% of rides being less than an hour long. The mode for trip duration for male users is again 5 minutes, 6 minutes for female users, and 11 minutes for users with an unknown gender.

## Summary
The analysis for the Citi Bike program in New York City for the month of August 2019 show trends that describe who would be using the Citi Bike program, when the program is being utilized, and for how long. From the analysis it is concluded that the typical user for a Citi Bike program in Des Moines, Iowa would be male subscribers. The program would be utilized mostly during user's commute to and from work, and then throughout the day on the weekend. The overwhelming majority of rides will be less than one hour long, and would have an average duration of 5 minutes.

Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis are:
1. A visualization showing the most and least popular routes that users take. This can be used to plan out where to place Citi Bike stations in Des Moines.
2. A visualization showing the lengths of routes by bike ID. This data can be used to determine which bikes are getting the most wear and tear, and far apart to place bike stations.
